Codetch
====================

A code editing extension to Firefox, Flock, etc.

Download and install
====================
Visit http://codetch.com/download in your Gecko browser and click the install link. After it installs, restart your browser. Done!

How to run the edge, repo version
===================

Download from repository:

  $ git clone git://github.com/riah/codetch-ext.git

Create a new file named "{420ed894-c19f-4318-a83f-bacae374db28}" in your browser's profile extensions directory. In my case, it could look like:

  $ touch /home/zach/.mozilla/firefox/{random}.default/extensions/{420ed894-c19f-4318-a83f-bacae374db28}

Note: I suggest using a diffrent profile than your default, in case something in the build is a mess.

In that new file, put the path to where you downloaded your repository. For me:

  /home/zach/xul/codetch-ext

Note: no extra spaces or any other lines, just the path.

Restart your browser and it should be installed and ready to use/hack.
