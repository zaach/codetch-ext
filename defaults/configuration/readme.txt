
Codetch Configuration
---------------------

In the doctypes directory you can edit the default template files for each file type.
In the templates directory you can edit the templates provided, or add you own. Just copy and paste them into the templates directory. You can also create you own subdirectories to organize your templates.

From within Codetch you can also open template files for editing, just press the "Edit template" button in the "New File" dialog.
